Let's work together to consolidate and clean three spreadsheets containing contingent workforce data.  I'll provide the data and instructions step-by-step, and I'll need your help at each stage.  We'll focus on cleaning, standardizing, structuring the data, and identifying missing information.  Your primary role is to follow my instructions precisely and provide feedback or ask clarifying questions if anything is unclear.  Do not attempt to infer or fill in any missing information that is not explicitly present in the source spreadsheets until I give instructions.

Here's an overview of the process we'll follow:

**Phase 1: Initial Setup and Data Upload (My Input)**
I will introduce the task and provide the spreadsheet data.

**Phase 2: Data Exploration and Field Identification (Collaboration)**
I will describe the data, and you will identify common fields across the spreadsheets.  We'll refine this together.

**Phase 3: Data Cleaning and Standardization (Collaboration)**
I will specify standardization rules (e.g., date formats, text case), and you will apply them. We'll review and refine these rules together.

**Phase 4: Data Structuring and Consolidation (Collaboration)**
I will explain how I want the data consolidated, and you will perform the consolidation.  We'll validate the results together.

**Phase 5: Missing Data Analysis (Collaboration)**
I will ask you to generate a report showing missing values.  We'll review the report.

**Phase 6: Final Output (My Input)**
I will request the final consolidated dataset and missing data report.

Throughout this process, please keep the following in mind:

* **Accuracy is paramount:**  Follow my instructions precisely. If you're unsure about anything, ask for clarification.
* **"NaN" for Missing Data:**  Use "NaN" to represent missing values. Do not attempt to guess or fill in missing information.
* **Step-by-Step:** We will proceed step-by-step.  Do not jump ahead.
* **Collaboration:** This is a collaborative effort.  Your feedback and questions are essential.

Are you ready to begin?

Yes, I'm ready to begin! Go ahead and upload the spreadsheets, and we'll start with Phase 1.

I’ve received the three files:

Contingent Workers Detail Report - WP 2025-01-28.csv
Invoiced_Timesheets_WP_2023-2025.csv
Active Contractor Report - Management Chain.csv
We’re now in Phase 2: Data Exploration and Field Identification.

To start, I'll inspect the structure of each file—checking column names, data types, and the first few rows. Then, I'll summarize the key fields.

Let me know if you have any specific instructions before I proceed!






You said:
Proceed. One thing to note is in the invoiced sheet, each working week that was invoiced by a worker is a separate row so there are significant amount of rows that seem as if its duplicates but they are just invoices per week. To note also bill rates, pay rates etc differ in their currency, pay frequency (hourly, daily, monthly etc.), LC Number identifies the workers ID number/employee number.
ChatGPT said:
Got it! The Invoiced Timesheets sheet contains multiple rows per worker, corresponding to different invoiced workweeks. Bill rates and pay rates vary in currency and pay frequency, and the LC Number is the worker’s unique ID. I'll keep these in mind while analyzing the data.

Now, I’ll inspect each file’s structure—column names, data types, and a preview of the first few rows. Let’s start.

It looks like one or more of the files contain special characters that aren't compatible with UTF-8 encoding. I'll try a different encoding (ISO-8859-1) to see if that resolves the issue. Let me retry loading the files. ​​

  [5 rows x 27 columns]})
Initial Findings:
Here’s a summary of the column names and structure for each file:

1. Contingent Workers Detail Report (35 columns)
Worker Info: Worker ID, Worker Name, Email - Primary Work
Position Details: Position ID, Business Title, Job Code, Worker Status
Compensation: Contract Pay Rate for Primary Position, Contract Pay Rate Frequency, Currency for Primary Position
Location: Location, Country, Remote Worker?
Employment Dates: Hire Date, Contract End Date
Management Structure: Supervisor Level 2-4, Manager ID, Manager Name, Manager Work Email, Manager Job Title
2. Invoiced Timesheets (29 columns)
Worker Info: Contractor Name, LC Number (Worker ID)
Assignment Details: Assignment ID, Assignment Status, Job Title, Labor Category
Dates: Assignment Start Date, Assignment End Date, Week Ending Date
Financials: Bill Rate, Bill Rate Type Code, Invoiced Units, Invoiced Gross, Invoiced Net, Currency
Management: Manager Hierarchy Level 3-5
3. Active Contractor Report - Management Chain (27 columns)
Worker Info: Contractor Name, LC Number
Assignment Details: Assignment ID, Assignment Status, Job Title, Industry
Employment Dates: Original Tenure Start Date, Current End Date
Financials: Bill Rate, OT Rate, Currency
Location: Physical Work Location, Physical Work Location City/State/Country
Management: Manager Hierarchy Level 3-4, Hiring Manager
Next Step: Field Identification & Common Columns
Now, let's determine which fields are common across all files so we can align and consolidate them.

Here are some potentially matching fields based on my first pass:

Worker Identifier: Worker ID (Detail Report) vs. LC Number (Invoiced & Contractor Report)
Worker Name: Worker Name (Detail Report) vs. Contractor Name (Others)
Job Title: Business Title (Detail Report) vs. Job Title (Others)
Employment Dates: Hire Date / Contract End Date vs. Assignment Start Date / Assignment End Date
Financials: Contract Pay Rate vs. Bill Rate
Management Structure: Manager ID, Manager Name vs. Manager Hierarchy
Would you like me to formally list and align the common columns across all three datasets? Or do you have specific fields in mind that you want to focus on? ​​






You said:
List and align on common columns across all three datasets
ChatGPT said:
Common Columns Across All Three Datasets
Based on my review, here are the common fields that exist in all three files, along with how they appear in each dataset.

Common Field	Contingent Workers Detail Report	Invoiced Timesheets	Active Contractor Report
Worker ID (Unique ID)	Worker ID	LC Number	LC Number
Worker Name	Worker Name	Contractor Name	Contractor Name
Job Title	Business Title	Job Title	Job Title
Assignment ID	Not Available	Assignment ID	Assignment ID
Assignment Status	Not Available	Assignment Status	Assignment Status
Start Date	Hire Date	Assignment Start Date	Original Tenure Start Date
End Date	Contract End Date	Assignment End Date	Current End Date
Pay Rate / Bill Rate	Contract Pay Rate for Primary Position	Bill Rate	Bill Rate
Pay Rate Frequency	Contract Pay Rate Frequency	Bill Rate Type Code	Not Available
Currency	Currency for Primary Position	Currency	Currency
Location	Location	Physical Work Location	Physical Work Location
City	Not Available	Physical Work Location City	Physical Work Location City
State	Not Available	Not Available	Physical Work Location State
Country	Country	Not Available	Physical Work Location Country
Manager (Direct Supervisor)	Manager Name	Not Available	Hiring Manager
Management Hierarchy	Supervisor Level 2-4, Manager ID	Manager Hierarchy Level 3-5	Manager Hierarchy Level 3-4
Supplier	Contingent Worker Supplier	Supplier	Supplier
Key Observations:
Worker ID and Name appear consistently across all files, though named differently in some cases (Worker ID vs. LC Number).
Job Titles are consistently available, but they may need standardization.
Assignment IDs and Statuses exist in Invoiced and Active Contractor Reports but not in the Detail Report.
Financial Information (Pay Rates & Currency) exists in all datasets, but Pay Frequency is missing in the Active Contractor Report.
Location Details are spread across all files, but City/State are missing from the Detail Report.
Management Hierarchy exists in all files, but levels may not align perfectly.
Next Step:
Would you like to:

Standardize column names across all files before proceeding with cleaning?
Review any specific field mappings further?
Move to data cleaning and standardization? (e.g., normalizing date formats, handling currencies, etc.)





You said:
Let's standardize the names first.
ChatGPT said:
Great! Below is a proposed standardized column name mapping for all three datasets. I’ve chosen consistent, descriptive names while keeping them aligned with your data.

Proposed Standardized Column Names
Standardized Name	Contingent Workers Detail Report	Invoiced Timesheets	Active Contractor Report
Worker_ID	Worker ID	LC Number	LC Number
Worker_Name	Worker Name	Contractor Name	Contractor Name
Job_Title	Business Title	Job Title	Job Title
Assignment_ID	Not Available	Assignment ID	Assignment ID
Assignment_Status	Not Available	Assignment Status	Assignment Status
Start_Date	Hire Date	Assignment Start Date	Original Tenure Start Date
End_Date	Contract End Date	Assignment End Date	Current End Date
Pay_Rate	Contract Pay Rate for Primary Position	Bill Rate	Bill Rate
Pay_Rate_Frequency	Contract Pay Rate Frequency	Bill Rate Type Code	Not Available
Currency	Currency for Primary Position	Currency	Currency
Location	Location	Physical Work Location	Physical Work Location
City	Not Available	Physical Work Location City	Physical Work Location City
State	Not Available	Not Available	Physical Work Location State
Country	Country	Not Available	Physical Work Location Country
Direct_Manager	Manager Name	Not Available	Hiring Manager
Manager_Level_3	Supervisor Level 2	Manager Hierarchy Level 3	Manager Hierarchy Level 3
Manager_Level_4	Supervisor Level 3	Manager Hierarchy Level 4	Manager Hierarchy Level 4
Supplier	Contingent Worker Supplier	Supplier	Supplier
Next Steps:
Do you approve these standardized column names?
Let me know if you’d like any changes.
Once approved, I will rename the columns in all three datasets accordingly.





You said:
Is there anything for cost center, BUC or billing company number that can be aligned?
ChatGPT said:
Good catch! Let’s align fields related to Cost Center, BUC (Bill to BUC), and Billing Company Number across all three datasets.

Proposed Standardized Column Names for Cost Center & Billing Info
Standardized Name	Contingent Workers Detail Report	Invoiced Timesheets	Active Contractor Report
Cost_Center_ID	Cost Center - ID	Not Available	Bill to BUC Code
Cost_Center_Name	Cost Center - Name	Not Available	Bill to BUC Name
BUC_Code	Not Available	Assignment Bill to BUC	Bill to BUC Code
BUC_Name	Not Available	Not Available	Bill to BUC Name
Billing_GL_Number	Not Available	GL Number	Not Available
Key Observations & Alignment Notes:
Cost Center exists in the Detail Report and Active Contractor Report but is absent in the Invoiced Timesheets file.
BUC Code (Bill to BUC Code) aligns with Cost Center ID, but it's named differently across reports.
BUC Name aligns with Cost Center Name in a similar way.
GL Number exists only in the Invoiced Timesheets file, which might relate to cost tracking.
Would you like to keep Cost Center ID & Name separate from BUC Code & Name, or should we treat them as equivalent fields?






You said:
Review the data in each of those sheets/columns and see if the data is similar. Do a random validation if needed.
ChatGPT said:
Good idea! I'll now analyze the Cost Center, BUC Code, and Billing GL Number fields in each dataset to check for similarities. I'll:

Look at unique values in each column.
Compare samples across datasets to see if they align.
Identify any clear patterns or differences.
Let's run this analysis now.

Findings from Cost Center & BUC Code Analysis
1. Cost Center ID (Detail Report) vs. BUC Code (Invoice & Active Contractor)
The values in Cost Center - ID (Detail Report) and BUC Code (Invoice & Active Contractor) are structurally similar.
Example comparisons:
3578.517106.9831..0000.WC01.1325 (Detail) vs. 3578.501002.9877..0000.0000.1325 (Invoice)
3506.500005.9140..0000.0000.1159 (Detail) vs. 3506.500004.9028..0000.A014.1159 (Active Contractor)
Conclusion: They appear to refer to the same kind of financial entity but may have slight differences in numbering.
2. GL Number (Invoice) vs. Cost Center ID (Detail)
GL Number (Invoice) has different formats and does not match the Cost Center ID structure exactly.
Conclusion: GL Number is likely a separate financial tracking field, not directly linked to Cost Center.
3. Cost Center Name (Detail) vs. BUC Name (Active Contractor)
We didn’t extract samples of Cost Center - Name yet, but since BUC Code aligns with Cost Center ID, it’s likely that BUC Name and Cost Center Name are also related.
Next Action: Would you like me to pull sample values of Cost Center Name to confirm?
Final Recommendation for Standardization
Standardized Name	Contingent Workers Detail Report	Invoiced Timesheets	Active Contractor Report
Cost_Center_ID	Cost Center - ID	Not Available	Bill to BUC Code
Cost_Center_Name	Cost Center - Name	Not Available	Bill to BUC Name
BUC_Code	Not Available	Assignment Bill to BUC	Bill to BUC Code
BUC_Name	Not Available	Not Available	Bill to BUC Name
Billing_GL_Number	Not Available	GL Number	Not Available
Would you like to proceed with this mapping? Or should we validate Cost Center Name vs. BUC Name further? ​​






You said:
Standardize the CC with BUC across all three
ChatGPT said:
Got it! I will now rename Cost Center fields to BUC fields across all three datasets to maintain consistency.

Final Standardized Column Mapping for BUC (Cost Center) Fields
Standardized Name	Contingent Workers Detail Report	Invoiced Timesheets	Active Contractor Report
BUC_Code	Cost Center - ID	Assignment Bill to BUC	Bill to BUC Code
BUC_Name	Cost Center - Name	Not Available	Bill to BUC Name
Billing_GL_Number	Not Available	GL Number	Not Available
Now, I'll proceed with renaming the columns in all three datasets accordingly.
